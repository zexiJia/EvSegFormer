# EvSegFormer
This work proses an approach for learning semantic segmentation from only event-based information (event-based cameras).

Noticing that event data naturally highlight moving objects, we propose a posterior attention module that adjusts the standard attention by the prior knowledge provided by event data. The posterior attention module can be readily plugged into many segmentation backbones.
